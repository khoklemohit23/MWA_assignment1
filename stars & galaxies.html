            <h2>The Life of Stars</h2>
            <p>Stars are the fundamental building blocks of galaxies, and their life cycles shape the universe. Stars are born in stellar nurseries, live their lives producing light and heat, and eventually die in supernovae, black holes, or neutron stars.</p>

            <h2>The Mysteries of Galaxies</h2>
            <p>Galaxies are vast systems of stars, dust, and gas bound together by gravity. The Milky Way, our home galaxy, contains billions of stars. But beyond that, countless other galaxies stretch across the universe, from spiral galaxies to elliptical and irregular ones.</p>

                <h3>Star Formation</h3>
                <p>Stars form in nebulae, which are clouds of gas and dust. Gravity pulls the materials together, igniting nuclear fusion.</p>
