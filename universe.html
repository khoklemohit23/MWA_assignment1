            <h2>The Expanding Universe</h2>
            <p>The universe has been expanding since the Big Bang about 13.8 billion years ago. As space expands, galaxies move away from each other. This discovery led to the revolutionary understanding of the universe's origin and its ever-changing nature.</p>

            <h2>Black Holes & Dark Matter</h2>
            <p>Black holes are regions of space with gravity so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. Dark matter, which we cannot see, makes up a significant part of the universe's mass, influencing the motion of galaxies and stars.</p>
